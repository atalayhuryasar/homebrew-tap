  # The tag is written out rather than interpolated from `version`. Homebrew orders
  # url before version, so "#{version}" in the class body would expand to an empty
  # string and the download would 404 on "v.tar.gz". Both lines are literal and have to
  # be bumped together.

  # Found by running brew install rather than brew style.

  # A plain Go binary, no cgo, nothing needed at runtime except git. That is what makes
  # building it from source acceptable here. Built from the tagged source so a given
  # formula version always produces the same commit.

    # Two things have to be right here, and neither is obvious:
    #
    #   - the package must be named, or go build targets the module root and fails with
    #     "no Go files";
    #   - output must be a plain name, not bin/, or the binary lands in the Cellar and
    #     the bin.install below cannot find it.
    #
    # std_go_args already supplies -s -w and takes no version keyword, so the ldflag
    # carries only the version.
